# Our Mission
### Public Data, Transparently Analyzed

The only truth we can believe with certainty is our own lived experience.

We rely on third-party data to fill in the gaps. But that data reaches us through a maze of media and algorithms that profit from our rage and fear. These “truths” are **self-serving**, not **self-evident**.

This project exists to make publicly available datasets easier to query, analyze, and join. It's also personal: we have questions, and we're following the evidence.

Join us.

# Our Story

Hi it's me, Anne!!!

I've worked as a data scientist at two companies (Revel & Propel). When you work at a tech company, data is readily available and easily explored.

But this doesn't exist for the most pressing data we have - the data that informs us about the state of our country and our neighbors' wellbeing. 

This data is siloed. It's also intimidating. I'm learning as I go, and hopefully making it a little easier for the next gal.
